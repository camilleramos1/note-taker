## Description ✏️
Using starter code, I created a note taker application. I used Express.js, uuid, and Nodejs to apply functionality to the front end starter code that was provided. 

## Link To Live Application 📄

## Installation 💾
This application is deployed on Heroku, so user is able to simply click the deployed application link to conveniently use the app. To use the app locally, user needs to clone this repo and ensure they have Nodejs installed. Open the files, and run node server.js in the terminal. 

## Usage 💻
After opening this application, user will see a landing page titled "Note Taker". Click on the blue "Get Started" button to proceed to the app. 

Here you can type in a title and body of a note you would like to save. In order to save, click the white floppy disk at the top right of the navigation bar. If you would like to create another note, you can simply save or click the white plus sign also at the top right of the navigation bar. The notes will populate in the left column. 

I have also implemented a delete button, which is located on the left column next to each saved note. Simply click the red trash can button next to the note you would like to delete and it will no longer show in the left column.
